I May Never

I may never sit with kings

I may never own a condo and things



I may never take a trip around the      ​world

Nor ever be an American beauty ​girl.



None of these will even matter

In my Father's house are riches ​untold that

will never shatter



I may never even visit Palms ​Springs,

I may never enjoy what riches bring,



I may never be in the company of ​the elite,

These things too will never matter

If I could only dwell with Christ

It would be an eternal delight.
